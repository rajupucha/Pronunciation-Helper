# Pronunciation-Helper
Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Convertor Project Application
***Pronunciation Helper*** is a web-based application developed to improve English pronunciation through a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly interface. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it integrates ***Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT)*** technologies through browser-native APIs to provide real-time feedback on spoken input. Users can listen to the correct pronunciation and immediately compare it with their own speech. A key feature is ***phoneme visualization***, which breaks down words into individual sound units, helping learners correct mispronunciations with visual support. The system also includes ***accuracy tracking and mismatch highlighting***, clearly showing differences between user input and target phrases. It supports multiple English accents and offers customizable voice options. ***No installation is needed, and it works smoothly across desktop and mobile browsers***. Designed for ESL learners, students, and professionals, Pronunciation Helper promotes independent learning, improves speech clarity, and makes pronunciation training more effective and engaging.
